# Example BLoC Architecture

Example project to explore the BLoC architecture and learn Flutter/Dart

## What's about?

The aim of this project is to learn Flutter and BLoC architecture, as well as keeping things simple, 
secure while using good software development practices.

## What I should know

If you want to clone this project and try it out, you should follow the next steps:

### API KEY

Create an `assets` folder juts in the root of this project, and inside it, you would need to store
the `secrets.json` file.

The IMDB **API Key** could be obtained from this [link](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)

*secrets.json:*

```
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

### How to generate the automatic JSON parsing code?

If the files inside `models/` folder are changed, we would need to run:

>$ flutter packages pub run build_runner watch

In order to automatically generate the *.g* files, that would contain the necessary code for JSON parsing given a model.

## What's done & left to do?

- [x] BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture
- [x] JSON Serialization
- [x] Load a list retrieved from a web service
- [x] Hide Secret API Key
- [ ] Business models & Data models
- [ ] Mapper between models 
- [x] Open detail when clicking on an item
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Widget tests
- [ ] Code coverage report
- [ ] Check that code style is following most of Dart/Flutter specs
